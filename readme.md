# Duden.de Search Workflow
Simple dictionary search workflow for Alfred users
____________________
## How to install
The workflow uses python3 internally, for which you'll first need to execute a couple simple steps.

The first step is to install the Homebrew version of python3 with pip3.
```bash
brew install python
```

To make sure the right version has been installed, check the output of `which python3`. It should be `/usr/local/bin/python3`.

Next, we have to install a package for python which is not available out of the box. To do so, execute the following command:
```bash
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
```

Now you can import the workflow, which you can directly download from the [releases](https://github.com/wlchs/alfred_workflow_duden_de/releases) page.
